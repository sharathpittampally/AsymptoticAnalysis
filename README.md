Notes on calculating time and space complexities for iterative and recursive algorithms
#### Iterative analysis:
- Always think in terms of how much time the function will take to finish(Or how many times the loop will get executed) in terms of the input value provided.
- You have to determine that "*how many times the loop will get executed*" in terms of the input value and that will be your time complexity for the function.
#### Recursive analysis:
